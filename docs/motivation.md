# Drug Resistance in Cancer 

Precision oncology operates on the concept that cancers can effectively be killed by targeting specific cancer genetics or states. This has seen remarkable success in a variety of cancers; however, this field has been stymied by the evolved or adaptive `drug resistance`. One of the major models of targeted therapies of drug resistance can be viewed in the figure below [1]. Drug resistance is estimated to be responsible for up to 90% of the deaths in cancer patients taking chemotherapy or targeted therapies [2]. A common model of drug resistance is that of evolved resistance, in which the therapy acts as a selective pressure - e.g., killing of sensitive cancer clones, but leaving behind a cadre of resistance clones that grow into a resistant tumor.

# Drug combinations to combat drug resistance 

Drug combinations have been proposed as method of preventing drug resistance and resensitizing multi-drug resistance. This is rationalized along several dimensions. First, by targeting multiple driver genes, it may be possible to reduce residual disease as a greater number of cancer clones are plausibly sensitive. Additionally, by using more than one drug it may be possible to `resensitize` a drug-resistant tumor, leading to renewed sensitivity and better patient outcome. Last, drug synergy occurs when two drugs in combination have an improved response than either of the drugs individually - this behavior can improve patient outcome and/or reduce side effects and toxicity.
